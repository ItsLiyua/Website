        coordinates in an accepted coordinate system, its own form, its own state parameter that indicates its belonging

            <h1>Know the difference: Voxels and Pixels</h1>
            <p>
                Voxels and pixels are at their core the same, a piece of an image but there are major differences
                between
                the
                two:

                The most glaring difference between voxels and pixels is the fact that pixels are two-dimensional and
                create
                a
                flat image when put together while voxels are three-dimensional and form a mesh when put together.
                Furthermore, voxels can have textures applied to them, while pixels can only represent a single color.
                Additionally, the size of voxels may vary greatly while a pixel will always have the size of a
                pixel, but a voxel when used in a game usually has the size of one measuring unit in the given game.
                Another
                point would be the shape which for a pixel is a square but a voxel may take on the shape of any cube or
                cuboid
                that can be formed with 12 triangles.

            <h1>Voxels and Polygons</h1>
            <p class="text">What is the difference between a voxel and a polygon?
                <br>
                <br>
                A voxel and a polygon are both used in computer graphics to represent objects or scenes, but they are
                fundamentally different.
                <br>
                <br>
                A voxel (short for "volume element") is a three-dimensional pixel, which represents a point in space
                that contains information about color, transparency, or other attributes. Voxel data is often used to
                create volumetric models, such as medical scans or scientific simulations. A voxel is represented as a
                cube, and the resolution of a voxel model is determined by the size of these cubes. A higher resolution
                voxel model contains smaller cubes and can represent more detail, but it also requires more memory and
                processing power.
                <br>
                <br>
                On the other hand, a polygon is a two-dimensional shape made up of straight lines and vertices that
                define its shape. Polygons are used to represent the surfaces of three-dimensional objects in computer
                graphics. Polygon models are constructed by creating a network of interconnected polygons, often called
                a mesh. The vertices of the polygons define the shape of the object and can be manipulated to create
                different shapes and sizes. The resolution of a polygon model is determined by the number of polygons
                used to construct it. A higher resolution polygon model contains more polygons and can represent more
                detail, but it also requires more memory and processing power.
                <br>
                <br>
                In summary, the main difference between a voxel and a polygon is that a voxel is a three-dimensional
                pixel that represents a point in space, while a polygon is a two-dimensional shape used to construct a
                three-dimensional object's surface. Voxel data is used for volumetric modeling, while polygon data is
                used for surface modeling.</p>
