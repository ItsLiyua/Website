        "Voxel is an image of a three-dimensional space region limited by given sizes, which has its own nodal point
        coordinates in an accepted coordinate system, its own form, its own state parameter that indicates its belonging
        to some modeled object, and has properties of modeled region." -

        <h1>Know the difference: Voxels and Pixels</h1>
        <p>
            Voxels and pixels are at their core the same, a piece of an image but there are major differences between the
            two:

            The most glaring difference between voxels and pixels is the fact that pixels are two-dimensional and create a
            flat image when put together while voxels are three-dimensional and form a mesh when put together.
            Furthermore voxels can have textures applied to them, while pixels can only represent a single color.
            Additionally the size of voxels may vary greatly while a pixel will always have the size of a
            pixel, but a voxel when used in a game usually has the size of one measuring unit in the given game. Another
            point would be the shape which for a pixel is a square but a voxel may take on the shape of any cube or cuboid
            that can be formed with 12 triangles.
