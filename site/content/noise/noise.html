        "Perlin noise is a type of gradient noise developed by Ken Perlin in 1983. It has many uses, including but not
        limited to: procedurally generating terrain, applying pseudo-random changes to a variable, and assisting in the
        creation of image textures. It is most commonly implemented in two, three, or four dimensions, but can be
        defined for any number of dimensions." -

        <p>
            Noise are pseudo-randomly generated values which are affected by their neighbor values. Usually these values
            are normalized, which means they may have a possible value between zero and one. Noise is most commonly
            utilized in the generation of heightmaps in open-world-games but can also be used to generate any kind of
            pseudo-random pattern.
